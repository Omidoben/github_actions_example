# GitHub Actions Example: Automating Quarto Document Publishing
This repository demonstrates how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow from RStudio to automate the rendering of a Quarto document and publish it to a Netlify website.

## Key Features
* Automated Workflow: Leverages GitHub Actions to schedule and trigger the rendering of a Quarto document.
* Dynamic Updates: The Quarto document includes the current timestamp to showcase real-time rendering.
* Netlify Deployment: Publishes the rendered document seamlessly to a live Netlify-hosted website.

#### Example Output
The Quarto document dynamically generates content with the current date and time. For example:

Hello. This file was rendered at 10/12/2024 08:34.
